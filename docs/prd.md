# 2. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

## Core Aim & Use Cases

### AI Tools Overview

- **Current Deployment**: 12 existing bots
- **In Development**: New bots for reporting automation, planning support, etc.

### Primary Objectives

1. Reduce manual tasks (reporting, data entry)
2. Improve staff efficiency
3. Grow AI literacy

### High-Level Targets

- 75% of core processes to be AI-enabled
- Achieve measurable cost and time savings
- Increase staff confidence and skill-building with AI

## Metrics to Track

### Efficiency Metrics

- Hours Saved (per process, per team)
- Cost Savings (hours saved Ã— average rate)

### Usage Metrics

- Active AI Users (weekly/monthly)
- Chatbot Usage
  - Number of conversations
  - Number of unique users

### Training & Development

- Training Completion (% of staff completing training modules)
- Confidence Score (% of staff reporting "high AI confidence")
- New AI Projects or Bots (number of GPTs built or deployed)

### Business Impact

- Employee Progression (# of promotions or role expansions linked to AI efficiency)
- Client Satisfaction (NPS or other feedback changes attributed to AI-driven improvements)

## Reporting Format

### Monthly Board Pack

#### Slide A: Tangible Metrics

- Hours saved
- Cost offsets
- Usage statistics

#### Slide B: Intangible Metrics

- Confidence levels
- Skill-building progress
- Success stories

### Additional Reporting Elements

- RAG Model or Maturity Scale to rate each department's AI readiness
- Power Hours summary (ad-hoc sessions yielding improvements)

## Data Sources

### System Data

- ChatGPT Enterprise logs to track bot usage

### Manual Input

- Self-Reported Time Savings
  - Quick forms or spreadsheets from process owners
  - Example: "We used to spend 5 hours/week; now it's 2 hours/week"

### Feedback Collection

- Staff Surveys (intangible measures)
  - Confidence levels
  - Skill-building progress
- NPS or Client Feedback (for external-facing bots)

## Implementation Approach

1. **Audit Existing Bots**

   - Confirm usage
   - Assign owners
   - Measure time saved

2. **Create ROI Template**

   - Use model to convert hours saved to cost offsets

3. **Measurement Strategy**

   - Measure both tangible & intangible metrics
   - Provide monthly or quarterly updates

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Refine data-collection methods as usage grows
